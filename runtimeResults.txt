Note that:

- When calculating the parallel speed-up S, the time output by the code was used, which corresponds
  to the parallel calculation and does not include reading in the file or performing the serial check

- The serial execution time is the time output by the code when run with a single process


No. Process:                        Mean time (average of 3 runs)           Parallel speed-up, S:

Architecture that the timing runs were performed on:

8 CPUs, 16 cores, Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-6700 CPU @ 3.40GHz

One reason the parallel speed-up decreases as the number of processes increases is because communicating
between processes takes time which is not required when the program is run with one process. Also,
additional computations and tasks need to be performed with multiple processes such as scattering data
between them which are not performed using one process leading to performance penalties with more processes.
Finally, blocking communication is used meaning a process can potentially be sat idle waiting for another
process to call the corresponding function to initiate communication causing time to be spent doing nothing.
